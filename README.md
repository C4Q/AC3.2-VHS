## The Big Picture
C4C aims to promote access, for members of a given community district, through engagement. We have developed a solution to identify the most frequently reported 311 service requests, in the last 30 days, and correlated these details to a users respective community board. Moreover, we have provided a forum for discussion where pertinent issues can be identified among community members and brought to the attention of local leadership more often than monthly scheduled meetings allow for.
